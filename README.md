<img src="./images/PacMan1.png">

## Project Description
This project involes using JavaScript to make a Factory that generates Pacmen and moves them across the screen.

### How to Run
When the button "Add PacMan" is pressed, an image of Pacman is randomly positioned on the screen. 
When the button "Start Game" is pressed, each pacman will move across the screen in a randomn direction and velocity.
Once the pacman hits the edge of the screen it will bounce the opposite way. 

### Roadmap of future improvements
Animate the Pacman image to open and close mouth.
Have the Pacman image face the direction it is moving in
Add "Reset" button that clears the screen
Add background image
